Task 8

# Working with VPNs 


## Objective
Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.

### Tools Used

- **Kali Linux** for penetration testing and security auditing.
- - **Turbovpn** TurboVPN is a free VPN service mainly used to hide your IP address and encrypt internet traffic for basic privacy and access to blocked sites.
## Steps

Below are the key steps taken in this process:

### 1. Choose a reputable free VPN service and sign up.

Here i used TurboVPN. TurboVPN is a free VPN service mainly used to hide your IP address and encrypt internet traffic for basic privacy and access to blocked sites.

ProtonVPN (Free Tier) → https://protonvpn.com


### 2. Download and insta l the VPN client.



### 3. Connect to a VPN server (choose closest or any location).

Here i connected to singapore

### 4. Verify your IP address has changed (use whatismyipaddress.com).

### 5. Browse a website to confirm traffic is encrypted.

Here i navigated into ookla speed test website.

### 6. Disconnect VPN and compare browsing speed and IP.

### 7. Research VPN encryption and privacy features.

**Encryption Standards**

Most modern VPNs use AES-256 (Advanced Encryption Standard) – the same encryption used by banks and governments.

It provides strong protection against brute-force attacks.

**VPN Protocols**

- OpenVPN → Widely used, very secure, open-source.

- IKEv2/IPSec → Fast and stable, especially on mobile devices.

- WireGuard → New, lightweight, faster than OpenVPN with strong security.

- L2TP/IPSec → Older but still used in some cases.

**Tunneling & Data Protection**

VPNs create an encrypted tunnel between your device and the VPN server.

This prevents hackers, ISPs, or network admins from spying on your traffic.

**IP & Location Masking**

VPN hides your real IP address and replaces it with the VPN server’s IP.

This improves privacy and helps bypass geo-blocking.

**Privacy Features**

No-Logs Policy: Some VPNs promise not to store browsing history or activity.

Kill Switch: Disconnects internet if VPN drops, preventing IP/DNS leaks.

DNS/IPv6 Leak Protection: Ensures all requests are routed through the VPN.

Split Tunneling: Lets you choose which apps/websites use VPN and which use normal internet.

**Benefits for Security**

Protects data on public Wi-Fi (cafes, airports).

Prevents Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

Hides sensitive browsing (like online banking).


### 8. Write a summary on VPN benefits and limitations.

**Benefits**

- Encrypts traffic using strong algorithms (like AES-256), protecting data from hackers and ISPs.

- Masks your IP address, hiding your real location and identity online.

- Protects on public Wi-Fi, reducing the risk of Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

- Bypasses geo-restrictions to access blocked or region-limited content.

- Enhances privacy with features like kill switch, no-logs policies, and DNS leak protection.

**Limitations**

- Reduced speed due to encryption overhead and rerouting through VPN servers.

- Free VPNs may log data or show ads, which reduces privacy.

- Not 100% anonymous — VPN providers can still see connection metadata.

- Blocked by some services (e.g., streaming platforms or restricted networks).

- Depends on trust — security is only as strong as the VPN provider’s policies.

### 5. Conclusion

Using TurboVPN helped me understand how VPNs encrypt internet traffic and mask IP addresses to protect privacy and access restricted content, providing basic online security and anonymity.
