### 5. Conclusion

By reviewing my browser extensions, I learned how to identify suspicious add-ons based on permissions, source, and usage. I removed unnecessary ones and kept only trusted extensions. This task improved my awareness of browser security risks and gave me practical skills in managing extensions to reduce threats like data theft, tracking, and malicious redirects.
